#This is a fixed sized allocator implementation program built on top of memory allocation program.

#The program implements feature of creating a Fixed Sized Allocator which allocates fixed sized blocks of memory.

#Contain allocation and free function under 'FixedSizeAllocator.cpp' file to manage and optimize memory usage.

#Trying to allocate the memory if present within FixedSizeAllocator, else trying to allocate memory from heap using the alloc function under 'HeapManager.cpp'.

#BitArray class under BitArray.cpp file to track blocks usage status. Getting and setting all bits.
